# Mocklook
### iOS Engineer Challenge for Outlook iOS Mobile Team

## Who Am I?
My name is Alec Dilanchian and I am currently a consultant within enterprise services
at Microsoft. My passion extends deeply into mobile developing, specifically iOS,
starting back almost two years ago where I created my first iOS/watchOS app
Cycles - Daily Habit Creator (https://www.getcyclesappp.com). Some fun facts about me:

- I stream programming on Twitch (https://twitch.tv/adilanchian)
- Huge heavy metal music fan \m/
- Massive foody
- Have an extremely large passion for passing along the knowledge I have in programming to others

This challenge was incredible and I had a BLAST working on it over 
the course of three days. I would love feedback on Mocklook if you have any and 
I hope you enjoy!

## What is Mocklook?
Mocklook is a mock version of the widely used Outlook Mobile app for iPhone.
Mocklook has one view built out at the moment, the calendar/agenda view.
This view consists of a calendar view up top and a list of appointments beneath it.

## Features
Mocklook has the following features:
- Continuous scroll feature of both the calendar and agenda views (Spanning through the year 2018)
- Calendar and Agenda view allow a person to browse through days of the year
- Tap a date on the Calendar view to see the Agenda view update as well
- Use the Agenda view to move between dates and watch the Calendar view update
- Fluid expansion and shrinking of both the Calendar and Agenda views 
- Mock data that is randomized on each app start
- Real time weather integration for each appointment scheduled on the calendar
- Familiar UI from Outlook Mobile for iPhone

## Future Updates
Mocklook is an ever growing "mock" application that is just beginning. Some parts
that were skipped in this version of Mocklook are:

- Display of appointment members in agenda view
- More randomized mock data
- Multiple year calendar

## Shout Out
I want to give a shout out to SwiftSky (https://github.com/appcompany/SwiftSky).
I used their wrapper for grabbing current temperature stats from Dark Sky API.
